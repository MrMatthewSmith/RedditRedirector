# Reddit Blocker Extension – "New Man" Identity Edition

This Chrome extension is a personal behavior support tool built to help reinforce intentional habits and identity-based change.

## 🚫 What It Does

Originally, this extension redirected visits to distracting subreddits like `/r/politics`, `/r/popular`, and `/r/conservative` to `/r/pornfree`.

It has now been upgraded to:

- Block **all of Reddit** (`*.reddit.com`)
- Automatically **redirect the user to a custom warning page**
- Display **random quotes** pulled from my personal *"New Man Identity"* exercise

Each quote is designed to interrupt autopilot behavior and re-anchor me to the values and identity I'm building.

## 🌱 Why I Built It

I noticed that I often opened Reddit without thinking, especially during moments of stress, boredom, or emotional avoidance.

This tool isn't just a blocker — it's a redirector to **presence** and **purpose**. It reminds me:

- I know I don't need it anymore.
- I’m not chasing likes — I’m building a life I actually want.
- I'm done escaping. I’m choosing intentionally.

## 🧠 Identity Work

The quotes are pulled from this identity-shaping framework:

This includes:
- Old identity patterns
- New intentional beliefs
- Proof points and behaviors
- Future-self visualization practices

This extension was built for personal use.

I'm not a Chrome extension expert — most of this was generated with the help of AI.
If that's a problem for you, then maybe it's time to get over yourself.

Feel free to fork it, remix it, or ignore it. Just don’t try to sell it as your own genius.

This is more than a blocker.  
It’s a boundary with purpose.
